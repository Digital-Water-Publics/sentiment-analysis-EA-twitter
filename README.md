# Sentiment analysis of interactions with the UK Environment Agency on Twitter
**R files** 

This study investigates sentiment and substance of interactions with the UK Environment Agency (EA) on Twitter. The study builds on previous small-n qualitative research finding that both London residents and environmental charity workers express low levels of trust in the ability of the EA to effectively address urban water quality issues. Further findings from narrative interviews suggest that EA responsiveness differs by location and issue, with flood risk management taking precedence over urban stream pollution incidents. Some respondents spoke in stark terms of the lacklustre response they had received from the EA to repeated attempts at bringing urban water pollution to the attention of the organisation. Multiple research participants even expressed the sentiment that the EA had all but “given up” on its responsibility to protect and improve their local water environment. Consequently, this study explores how members of the public interact with the EA on Twitter: which issues are Twitter users likely to bring up in their interactions with the EA? How are their interactions emotionally charged and expressive of trust or distrust? Where do these interactions originate?
