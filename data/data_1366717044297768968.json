Dharma is a timeless concept and is found in ancient religious texts such as the Vedas and the Upanishads. Its meaning can vary depending on the context. However, it is generally considered to mean 'that which holds or supports the natural law or order of things'. It refers to leading a righteous life in harmony with natural laws, as ones moral obligation and calling. With core principles such as knowledge, purity, prosperity, charity, non-violence, truth, honesty, compassion for all living beings, love and respect, we aim to bring awareness and positive change for all our Go Dharmic campaigns and we hope to have your full support. Please take some time to have a look at our various campaigns as well as our Dharmic Aid Charity.

Dharma is a timeless concept and is found in ancient religious texts such as the Vedas and the Upanishads. Its meaning can vary depending on the context. However, it is generally considered to mean 'that which holds or supports the natural law or order of things'. It refers to leading a righteous life in harmony with natural laws, as ones moral obligation and calling. With core principles such as knowledge, purity, prosperity, charity, non-violence, truth, honesty, compassion for all living beings, love and respect, we aim to bring awareness and positive change for all our Go Dharmic campaigns and we hope to have your full support. Please take some time to have a look at our various campaigns as well as our Dharmic Aid Charity.
