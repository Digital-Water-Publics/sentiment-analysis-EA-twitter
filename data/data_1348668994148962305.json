This approach has been assisted by the development of metabarcoding PCR primers that are suited for detection of a wide range of taxa. However, little effort has gone into exploring the value of the non-target DNA sequences that are generated in every survey, but subsequently discarded. Here we demonstrate that fish-targeted markers widely employed in aquatic biomonitoring can also detect birds and mammals present in the surrounding habitats. We showcase this feature in three temperate estuaries over multiple seasons, where dozens of bird and mammal species offer valuable insights into spatial and temporal faunal variation. Our results indicate that existing metabarcode sequence data sets are suitable for mining and exploration of this \"molecular by-catch\", and that any future eDNA-based surveys can be designed to accommodate this enhanced property of this wide","unwound_url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.10.426097v1"}],"hashtags":{},"annotations":{}},"conversation_id":"1348680862573981696","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":11,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"author_id":"854696100141428738","created_at":"2021-01-11T17:19:09.000Z","context_annotations":{},"attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for iPhone","lang":"en","possibly_sensitive":false,"id":"1348680059876503552","text":"@OJS50 @EnvAgency There are any number of EA staff I know who would be ecstatic about getting £30k a year never mind £140k","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1348674064144019467"}],"entities":{"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":6,"username":"OJS50","id":"229520936"},{"start":7,"end":17,"username":"EnvAgency","id":"47331384"}],"urls":{},"hashtags":{},"annotations":[{"start":42,"end":43,"probability":0.5256,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"EA"}]},"conversation_id":"1348218312417832960","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":1,"reply_count":0,"like_count":2,"quote_count":0},"author_id":"4001262681","created_at":"2021-01-11T17:15:58.000Z","context_annotations":{},"in_reply_to_user_id":"229520936","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for Android","lang":"en","possibly_sensitive":false,"id":"1348679884458106886","text":"@scullyp @ElliotColburn still waiting for you to get behind Phillip Dunnes  @Dunne4Ludlow Bill\nAlso  @JamesBevanEA surely you should be pushing everyone to get behind it because they'll be doing you and @EnvAgency a big favour or are you still denying we have a problem?
