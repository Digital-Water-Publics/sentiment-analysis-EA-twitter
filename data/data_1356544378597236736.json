This paper proposes that analysis of catchments as social ecological systems can provide key insights into how social and ecological dynamics interact and how some of the negative consequences of unsustainable resource use or environmental degradation can be ameliorated. This requires recognition of the potential for community resilience as a core element of catchment resilience, and moves beyond more structural approaches to emphasize social dynamics. The proposals are based on a review of social ecological systems research, on methods for analyzing community resilience, and a review of social science and action research that suggest ways of generating resilience through community engageme","unwound_url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/13/3/349"}]},"source":"Twitter Web App","lang":"en","id":"1356564508840521731","text":"Do rivers dream of resilient communities?
