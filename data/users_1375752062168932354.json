Transport & Engineering","description":"Just a short email to say how impressed I am with Keltruck‚Äôs recycled truck parts. I dealt with Henry Wood and explained my situation at 3pm in the afternoon and could not believe an engine being delivered to my premises before 10am the following morning. The price was fantastic and Henry was an outstanding representative of Scania in the UK. The engine was delivered on one of their own vehicles and the driver extended the same courtesy as the salesman on the phone. I have always tried to buy pattern parts and from smaller recycling companies but this has been a complete eye opener for me as to cost and service. I have run lorries for over 20 years now and this has completely changed my false view that buying from a dealership is expensive and overpriced. As you have probably noticed I‚Äôm extremely happy and would appreciate it if you could pass my thanks on.
