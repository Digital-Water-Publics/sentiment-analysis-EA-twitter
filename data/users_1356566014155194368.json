This requires recognition of the potential for community resilience as a core element of catchment resilience, and moves beyond more structural approaches to emphasize social dynamics. The proposals are based on a review of social ecological systems research, on methods for analyzing community resilience, and a review of social science and action research that suggest ways of generating resilience through community engageme","unwound_url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/13/3/349"}],"mentions":[{"start":95,"end":105,"username":"EnvAgency","id":"47331384"},{"start":117,"end":128,"username":"Water_MDPI","id":"3644194033"},{"start":146,"end":156,"username":"lborogeog","id":"1706966528"},{"start":177,"end":189,"username":"Tara__Quinn","id":"510419658"},{"start":190,"end":200,"username":"drcbutler","id":"263740243"},{"start":201,"end":217,"username":"ExeterGeography","id":"368055869"},{"start":218,"end":232,"username":"UofE_Research","id":"121715841"},{"start":264,"end":279,"username":"MDPIOpenAccess","id":"251800979"}],"annotations":[{"start":166,"end":175,"probability":0.9663,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Kate Brown"}]},"author_id":"852123008","lang":"en","created_at":"2021-02-02T11:25:57.000Z","possibly_sensitive":false,"conversation_id":"1356564508840521731","text":"Do rivers dream of resilient communities?
