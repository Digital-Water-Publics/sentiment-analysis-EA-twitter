It starts its epic journey as a natural spring high up on Biddulph Moor, north of Stoke-on-Trent. As it travels through the city it is still in its infancy, and just a few feet wide in places. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Milton, in the north of the city. The diminutive channel here is easy to overlook, but it nevertheless still provides a great green corridor for connecting wildlife throughout the city.

Prioritisation for monitoring EOCs was formalised in 2019 in Europe through the development of the first voluntary groundwater watch list (GWWL). Despite this, groundwater occurrence data in the peer reviewed literature for Europe has not been reviewed to date. Questions surrounding the effect, toxicity, movement in the subsurface and unsaturated zone make the process of regulating EOC use difficult. The aim in Europe is to develop a unified strategy for the classification, and prioritisation of EOCs to be monitored in groundwater. This paper compiles evidence from the recent published studies from across Europe, since 2012 when the last major literature global review of EOCs in groundwater took place.
