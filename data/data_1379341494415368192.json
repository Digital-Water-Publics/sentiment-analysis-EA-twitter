However, ponds support proportionately high levels of biodiversity relative to other inland waters in Europe, and foraging by Eurasian otter Lutra lutra (L., 1758) could have considerable impacts on species composition in these small water bodies. The aim of the present study was to analyse otter spraints around ponds during two contrasting seasons (winter and spring) in north Norfolk (eastern England), where both otter and ponds are of particular conservation concern. Spraint density, prey diversity and the consumption of river-associated species were higher in spring than winter. In both seasons, birds were the most important prey category as ingested biomass. European eel Anguilla anguilla (L., 1758) and amphibians, specifically common frog Rana temporaria L., 1758 and common toad Bufo bufo (L., 1758), were more consumed in spring, whereas northern pike Esox lucius L., 1758 and tench Tin","unwound_url":"https://bioone.org/journals/folia-zoologica/volume-62/issue-3/fozo.v62.i3.a7.2013/Seasonal-use-of-ponds-as-foraging-habitat-by-Eurasian-otter/10.25225/fozo.v62.i3.a7.2013.full"}]},"created_at":"2021-04-06T11:45:27.000Z","source":"Twitter Web App","conversation_id":"1379153617312186382","text":"@numenini @froglifers @OuseEcologyEA @EnvAgencyAnglia Otter are known to do this to toads\nhttps://t.co/pbHmY0n2gC \n\nbut their legs have also been eaten by humans as counterfeit frogs legs too!","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":1,"reply_count":0,"like_count":4,"quote_count":0},"lang":"en","id":"1379399852833058817","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1379153617312186382"}],"context_annotations":{},"in_reply_to_user_id":"905573430"},{"author_id":"60868602","possibly_sensitive":false,"entities":{"annotations":{},"hashtags":{},"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":10,"username":"SianieRoo","id":"3369059458"},{"start":11,"end":25,"username":"PHE_EoEngland","id":"1377247476"},{"start":26,"end":40,"username":"ClareDinnisEA","id":"3095468219"},{"start":41,"end":51,"username":"EnvAgency","id":"47331384"},{"start":52,"end":65,"username":"BorisJohnson","id":"3131144855"},{"start":66,"end":82,"username":"MPGeorgeEustice","id":"1944323755"},{"start":83,"end":94,"username":"DefraGovUK","id":"50069007"}],"urls":{}},"created_at":"2021-04-06T11:32:28.000Z","source":"Twitter for iPad","conversation_id":"1379314528849125377","text":"@SianieRoo @PHE_EoEngland @ClareDinnisEA @EnvAgency @BorisJohnson @MPGeorgeEustice @DefraGovUK No one is listening, they're all tucked up in their beds, not being poisoned , they don't care.","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":1,"reply_count":0,"like_count":2,"quote_count":0},"lang":"en","id":"1379396583595372545","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1379314528849125377"}],"context_annotations":[{"domain":{"id":"10","name":"Person","description":"Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"},"entity":{"id":"857212166100754432","name":"Boris Johnson","description":"Prime Minister"}},{"domain":{"id":"35","name":"Politician","description":"Politicians in the world, like Joe Biden"},"entity":{"id":"857212166100754432","name":"Boris Johnson","description":"Prime Minister"}}],"in_reply_to_user_id":"3369059458"},{"author_id":"3900990557","possibly_sensitive":false,"entities":{"annotations":[{"start":116,"end":123,"probability":0.8683,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"Barnsley"}],"hashtags":{},"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":15,"username":"GreenspaceMPST","id":"988767119155359744"},{"start":16,"end":28,"username":"DanJarvisMP","id":"240202308"},{"start":29,"end":39,"username":"EnvAgency","id":"47331384"},{"start":40,"end":51,"username":"CommonsEAC","id":"976598653"},{"start":52,"end":68,"username":"KeepBritainTidy","id":"23832084"},{"start":158,"end":169,"username":"TWIGGS1985","id":"741359445112938496"},{"start":202,"end":218,"username":"BarnsleyCouncil","id":"23667177"},{"start":292,"end":302,"username":"McDonalds","id":"71026122"}],"urls":{}},"created_at":"2021-04-06T11:31:49.000Z","source":"Twitter for iPhone","conversation_id":"1379319785494810625","text":"@GreenspaceMPST @DanJarvisMP @EnvAgency @CommonsEAC @KeepBritainTidy 208 sacks of litter collected by volunteers in Barnsley over last weekend , supported by @TWIGGS1985.
