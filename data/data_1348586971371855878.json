molecular bycatch as a landscape-wide biomonitoring tool","description":"Environmental DNA analysis is rapidly transforming biodiversity monitoring and bolstering conservation applications worldwide. This approach has been assisted by the development of metabarcoding PCR primers that are suited for detection of a wide range of taxa. However, little effort has gone into exploring the value of the non-target DNA sequences that are generated in every survey, but subsequently discarded. Here we demonstrate that fish-targeted markers widely employed in aquatic biomonitoring can also detect birds and mammals present in the surrounding habitats. We showcase this feature in three temperate estuaries over multiple seasons, where dozens of bird and mammal species offer valuable insights into spatial and temporal faunal variation. Our results indicate that existing metabarcode sequence data sets are suitable for mining and exploration of this \"molecular by-catch\", and that any future eDNA-based surveys can be designed to accommodate this enhanced property of this wide","unwound_url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.10.426097v1"}]},"possibly_sensitive":false,"conversation_id":"1348624611152375808","created_at":"2021-01-11T13:35:38.000Z","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"retweeted","id":"1348569628277092353"}],"id":"1348624611152375808","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":11,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"source":"Twitter for Android","text":"RT @TheMarianiLab: We have a new story to tell! here:\nhttps://t.co/ARTpRHs9Hp\n@lynseyrharper @boopsboops @charles_baillie @owenwangensteen…","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"context_annotations":{}},{"lang":"en","author_id":"4901806517","entities":{"hashtags":{},"mentions":[{"start":3,"end":17,"username":"buttery_simon","id":"1313458405768663040"},{"start":46,"end":62,"username":"GroundControlGC","id":"1225829377"},{"start":76,"end":86,"username":"EnvAgency","id":"47331384"}],"annotations":{},"urls":{}},"possibly_sensitive":false,"conversation_id":"1348623959089143810","created_at":"2021-01-11T13:33:02.000Z","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"retweeted","id":"1347526032870559744"}],"id":"1348623959089143810","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":2,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"source":"Twitter for Android","text":"RT @buttery_simon: Bank clearance work by our @GroundControlGC team for the @EnvAgency clearing a blocked access path, on completion this w…","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"context_annotations":{}},{"lang":"en","author_id":"3220748210","entities":{"hashtags":{},"mentions":[{"start":3,"end":19,"username":"NFUEastMidlands","id":"1285818247"}],"annotations":{},"urls":{}},"possibly_sensitive":false,"conversation_id":"1348623590095204352","created_at":"2021-01-11T13:31:34.000Z","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"retweeted","id":"1348622446405038080"}],"id":"1348623590095204352","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":4,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"source":"Twitter for iPhone","text":"RT @NFUEastMidlands: 🌳 The Green Futures programme will get you bang up-to-date with the latest environmental and water rules for your farm…","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"context_annotations":{}},{"lang":"en","author_id":"1323156472063315969","entities":{"hashtags":{},"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":10,"username":"EnvAgency","id":"47331384"},{"start":11,"end":19,"username":"The_ONR","id":"532301381"}],"annotations":[{"start":86,"end":91,"probability":0.9971,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"London"}],"urls":{}},"possibly_sensitive":false,"conversation_id":"1348602087454560262","created_at":"2021-01-11T13:28:53.000Z","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1348602087454560262"}],"id":"1348622913780527104","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"source":"Twitter for iPad","text":"@EnvAgency @The_ONR You’ve lost the plot.
