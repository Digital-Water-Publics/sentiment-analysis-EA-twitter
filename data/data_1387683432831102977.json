Moreover, due to recent technological and computational advances, scientists are now increasingly aware that a wide variety of contaminants and other environmental stressors adversely affect organismal behavior and subsequent ecological outcomes in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. There is also a groundswell of concern that regulatory ecotoxicology does not adequately consider behavior, primarily due to a lack of standardized toxicity methods. This has, in turn, led to the exclusion of many behavioral ecotoxicology studies from chemical risk assessments. To improve understanding of the challenges and opportunities for behavioral ecotoxicology within regulatory toxicology/risk assessment, a unique workshop with international representatives from the fields of behavioral ecology, ecotoxicology, regulatory (eco)toxicology, neurotoxicology, test standardization, and risk assessment resulted in the formation of","unwound_url":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.0c06493"}],"annotations":{},"hashtags":{}},"context_annotations":[{"domain":{"id":"88","name":"Political Body","description":"A section of a government, like The Supreme Court"},"entity":{"id":"870708323540017153","name":"US Environmental Protection Agency","description":"US Environmental Protection Agency"}}],"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1387700796809166850"}],"conversation_id":"1387700796809166850","possibly_sensitive":false,"in_reply_to_user_id":"473227126","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":2,"reply_count":0,"like_count":9,"quote_count":0},"created_at":"2021-04-29T09:30:27.000Z","author_id":"473227126","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for Android","lang":"und","id":"1387700277533450241","text":"@CertusCC @PJennings88 @RiverChess @EnvAgency https://t.co/XWwA0a6J8I","entities":{"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":9,"username":"CertusCC","id":"126107523"},{"start":10,"end":22,"username":"PJennings88","id":"245080841"},{"start":23,"end":34,"username":"RiverChess","id":"241036365"},{"start":35,"end":45,"username":"EnvAgency","id":"47331384"}],"urls":[{"start":46,"end":69,"url":"https://t.co/XWwA0a6J8I","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/dd201/status/1387700277533450241/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/XWwA0a6J8I"}],"annotations":{},"hashtags":{}},"context_annotations":{},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1387694613394231299"}],"conversation_id":"1387656179766136833","possibly_sensitive":false,"in_reply_to_user_id":"126107523","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":3,"quote_count":0},"created_at":"2021-04-29T09:28:23.000Z","author_id":"49612611","attachments":{"media_keys":["16_1387700270034034690"]},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for iPhone","lang":"en","id":"1387699948989427714","text":"RT @Feargal_Sharkey: Is this what putting \"Pressure on the water industry to better protect the environment\", looks like? \n\n@EnvAgency?","entities":{"mentions":[{"start":3,"end":19,"username":"Feargal_Sharkey","id":"4001262681"},{"start":124,"end":134,"username":"EnvAgency","id":"47331384"}],"urls":{},"annotations":{},"hashtags":{}},"context_annotations":{},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"retweeted","id":"1387662707483156482"}],"conversation_id":"1387699948989427714","possibly_sensitive":false,"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":63,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"created_at":"2021-04-29T09:27:04.000Z","author_id":"460178045","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for iPhone","lang":"en","id":"1387698915504496640","text":"@BBCNews an amazing report on @WalleysL run by @RedIndustries2 .
