From their base at the Cairngorms National Park in Scotland, which is twice the size of the Lake District, presenters Chris Packham, Michaela Strachan and Gillian Burke discover ways that the area's animals survive the challenges that come with winter. With short days, plummeting temperatures and a lack of food, cameras monitor the animals' movements.
