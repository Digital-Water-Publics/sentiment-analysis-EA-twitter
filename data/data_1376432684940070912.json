The mid-Pliocene is a valuable time interval for investigating equilibrium climate at current atmospheric CO2 concentrations because atmospheric CO2 concentrations are thought to have been comparable to the current day and yet the climate and distribution of ecosystems were quite different. One intriguing, but not fully understood, feature of the early to mid-Pliocene climate is the amplified Arctic temperature response and its impact on Arctic ecosystems. Only the most recent models appear to correctly estimate the degree of warming in the Pliocene Arctic and validation of the currently proposed feedbacks is limited by scarce terrestrial records of climate and environment. Here we reconstruct the summer temperature and fire regime from a subfossil fen-peat deposit on west‚Äìcentral Ellesmere Island, Canada, that has been chronologically constrained using cosmogenic nuclide burial dating to 3.9+1.5/-0.5‚ÄâMa. The estimate for average mean summer temperature is 15.4¬±0.8‚Äâ‚àòC using s","unwound_url":"https://cp.copernicus.org/articles/15/1063/2019/"},{"start":352,"end":375,"url":"https://t.co/9lnlq3AMJe","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/TethLL/status/1376476004059766788/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/9lnlq3AMJe","images":{}},{"start":352,"end":375,"url":"https://t.co/9lnlq3AMJe","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/TethLL/status/1376476004059766788/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/9lnlq3AMJe","images":{}},{"start":352,"end":375,"url":"https://t.co/9lnlq3AMJe","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/TethLL/status/1376476004059766788/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/9lnlq3AMJe","images":{}},{"start":352,"end":375,"url":"https://t.co/9lnlq3AMJe","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/TethLL/status/1376476004059766788/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/9lnlq3AMJe","images":{}}],"annotations":{}},"in_reply_to_user_id":"383286237","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1376469631121162248"}],"possibly_sensitive":false,"author_id":"1393338992","attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1376475906256986115","3_1376475906261196802","3_1376475906408022018","3_1376475906701598723"]},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"id":"1376476004059766788","text":"@EmmaHowardBoyd @jane__eden @EnvAgency @DefraGovUK @COP26 @AdaptOurWorld @WRIAdaptation @floodmary @FCDOClimate @GCAdaptation STOP your #ClimateCrisis Büí© ‚ÄºÔ∏èCO2 levels have  NO  correlation with #ClimateChangeüëâüèº In the past, CO2 was LOWER but It was WARMER than today &amp; camels were  grazing in an  ICE FREE Arctic Oops  ü§¢ü§™ üò¨\nhttps://t.co/lm4wqP2o5P https://t.co/9lnlq3AMJe","conversation_id":"1376469631121162248","context_annotations":{},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for Android","created_at":"2021-03-29T10:05:39.000Z","lang":"en","entities":{"hashtags":{},"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":9,"username":"CertusCC","id":"126107523"},{"start":10,"end":22,"username":"pow_rebecca","id":"371201577"},{"start":23,"end":36,"username":"Dunne4Ludlow","id":"1650144662"},{"start":37,"end":48,"username":"DefraGovUK","id":"50069007"},{"start":49,"end":59,"username":"EnvAgency","id":"47331384"},{"start":60,"end":68,"username":"WaterUK","id":"45794653"}],"urls":{},"annotations":[{"start":295,"end":299,"probability":0.9973,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"China"}]},"in_reply_to_user_id":"126107523","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1376468216034246657"}],"possibly_sensitive":false,"author_id":"531723906","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":3,"reply_count":2,"like_count":6,"quote_count":0},"id":"1376475634671755264","text":"@CertusCC @pow_rebecca @Dunne4Ludlow @DefraGovUK @EnvAgency @WaterUK There are no incentives for water companies to do the right thing.
