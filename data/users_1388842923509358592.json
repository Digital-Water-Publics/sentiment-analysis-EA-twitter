As this period is a busy time of the year for the farming and outdoor communities in particular, regular topics covered include the production of food, nature conservation, and a look at a chosen area's culture and history. Stunning landscapes and a variety of wildlife also feature prominently."}}],"entities":{"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":14,"username":"Jamesxparsons","id":"2834948379"},{"start":15,"end":30,"username":"FFC_Commission","id":"923229146758737920"},{"start":31,"end":42,"username":"wrurestore","id":"1360109464104427521"},{"start":43,"end":55,"username":"EllieChowns","id":"493494710"},{"start":56,"end":66,"username":"EnvAgency","id":"47331384"},{"start":67,"end":82,"username":"BBCCountryfile","id":"186092483"},{"start":83,"end":99,"username":"FriendsUpperWye","id":"1372827624297402369"}],"urls":{},"hashtags":{},"annotations":{}},"in_reply_to_user_id":"1290635465733939209","author_id":"1290635465733939209","text":"@Jamesxparsons @FFC_Commission @wrurestore @EllieChowns @EnvAgency @BBCCountryfile @FriendsUpperWye","created_at":"2021-05-02T08:59:21.000Z","lang":"und","conversation_id":"1388196778693079041","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":1,"like_count":1,"quote_count":0},"attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for Android","possibly_sensitive":false,"id":"1388804045528240131","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1388801611527507968"}],"context_annotations":{},"entities":{"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":14,"username":"sunnyraisin62","id":"326390730"},{"start":15,"end":25,"username":"tayz_BETH","id":"195731617"},{"start":26,"end":36,"username":"SimonTagg","id":"19722428"},{"start":37,"end":51,"username":"Helen_Clinton","id":"415751020"},{"start":52,"end":62,"username":"EnvAgency","id":"47331384"},{"start":63,"end":78,"username":"RedIndustries2","id":"1006120322"}],"urls":{},"hashtags":{},"annotations":{}},"in_reply_to_user_id":"326390730","author_id":"916717747983257600","text":"@sunnyraisin62 @tayz_BETH @SimonTagg @Helen_Clinton @EnvAgency @RedIndustries2 Think you are spot on there and now the politicians jump on it for next weeks votes not to solve the issue which is kick red off level the quarry only fill with soil and rubble its not the place for a landfill it never was","created_at":"2021-05-02T10:34:21.000Z","lang":"en","conversation_id":"1388233241526738946","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":1,"reply_count":1,"like_count":1,"quote_count":0},"attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for Android","possibly_sensitive":false,"id":"1388789744025358343","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1388787299408875520"}],"context_annotations":{},"entities":{"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":14,"username":"sunnyraisin62","id":"326390730"},{"start":15,"end":25,"username":"tayz_BETH","id":"195731617"},{"start":26,"end":36,"username":"SimonTagg","id":"19722428"},{"start":37,"end":51,"username":"Helen_Clinton","id":"415751020"},{"start":52,"end":62,"username":"EnvAgency","id":"47331384"},{"start":63,"end":78,"username":"RedIndustries2","id":"1006120322"}],"urls":{},"hashtags":{},"annotations":{}},"in_reply_to_user_id":"326390730","author_id":"916717747983257600","text":"@sunnyraisin62 @tayz_BETH @SimonTagg @Helen_Clinton @EnvAgency @RedIndustries2 I think the council are as much involved as the environmental agency its all about money üí∞back handers there is a tip up here on council land 4 times they have tried to sell it off for houses and we have objected it contains very dangerous chemicals they don't care about health","created_at":"2021-05-02T09:37:32.000Z","lang":"en","conversation_id":"1388233241526738946","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":2,"reply_count":1,"like_count":1,"quote_count":0},"attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"geo":{}}]}
