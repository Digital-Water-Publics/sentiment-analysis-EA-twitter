As this period is a busy time of the year for the farming and outdoor communities in particular, regular topics covered include the production of food, nature conservation, and a look at a chosen area's culture and history. Stunning landscapes and a variety of wildlife also feature prominently."}}],"in_reply_to_user_id":"369132023","geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for iPhone","id":"1321013412319604737","lang":"en","created_at":"2020-10-27T08:58:35.000Z","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":29,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"text":"RT @TonyJuniper: Yes good to see some analysis to explain the capacity gap that exists between rising environmental ambitions &amp; the ability‚Ä¶","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"retweeted","id":"1320640418808320002"}],"conversation_id":"1321013412319604737","possibly_sensitive":false,"entities":{"mentions":[{"start":3,"end":15,"username":"TonyJuniper","id":"78600745"}],"urls":{},"hashtags":{},"annotations":{}},"author_id":"4902544515","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"context_annotations":{},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for iPhone","id":"1321013032445747200","lang":"en","created_at":"2020-10-27T08:57:04.000Z","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":2,"quote_count":0},"text":"@WildHaweswater @RSPBEngland @Natures_Voice @RSPBNews @unitedutilities @EnvAgency @NECumbria @ebsford @AquaUoS @lakedistrictnpa @TheFloodHub Swindale - my favourite","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1321011246741835776"}],"conversation_id":"1321011246741835776","possibly_sensitive":false,"entities":{"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":15,"username":"WildHaweswater","id":"1151070563319910400"},{"start":16,"end":28,"username":"RSPBEngland","id":"189900089"},{"start":29,"end":43,"username":"Natures_Voice","id":"19255050"},{"start":44,"end":53,"username":"RSPBNews","id":"2168459394"},{"start":54,"end":70,"username":"unitedutilities","id":"20982364"},{"start":71,"end":81,"username":"EnvAgency","id":"47331384"},{"start":82,"end":92,"username":"NECumbria","id":"2557182607"},{"start":93,"end":101,"username":"ebsford","id":"369030841"},{"start":102,"end":110,"username":"Aquauos","id":"1388416206340829184"},{"start":111,"end":127,"username":"lakedistrictnpa","id":"188280373"},{"start":128,"end":140,"username":"TheFloodHub","id":"906074455402844160"}],"urls":{},"hashtags":{},"annotations":{}},"author_id":"46077091","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"context_annotations":{},"in_reply_to_user_id":"1151070563319910400","geo":{}}]
