The aim here was to test for the temporal and spatial consistency of migratory phenotypes in a common bream Abramis brama (‚Äòbream‚Äô) population, and then determine their social preferences and extent of mixing across three successive annual spawning periods. The study applied passive acoustic telemetry to track the movements of bream in the River Bure system of the Norfolk Broads, a lowland wetland comprising highly connected riverine and lacustrine habitats. Analyses revealed that individual migratory phenotype was highly consistent across the 3 years, but this was not predicted by fish sex or length at tagging.
