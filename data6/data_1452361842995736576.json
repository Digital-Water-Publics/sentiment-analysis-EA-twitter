I thought nothing of it. Yes, the sea was a tiny bit choppy, but I had my tow-float, and I was only planning a quick dip in shallow water, swimming parallel with the shore. So I gave the RNLI hut a wide berth. The lifeguard came running after me. ‘Wait!’ I groaned. He was going to tell me off, and now it would be awkward if I still wanted to swim. But what he said surprised me. ‘I wouldn’t advise going in today. The water quality’s not very good. There’s been a  sewage overspill after the storms.’ Sewage? No, please! Not on my beautiful beach. But apparently after heavy rains the run-off is common. All this time, I’d assumed the red flags were just there to warn of rough seas. In fact, Boscombe – one of the beaches the UK flocked to during the Covid pandemic – was identified in a recent Guardian report as being one of those where untreated wastewater is discharged.
