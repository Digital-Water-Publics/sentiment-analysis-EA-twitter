The mid-Pliocene is a valuable time interval for investigating equilibrium climate at current atmospheric CO2 concentrations because atmospheric CO2 concentrations are thought to have been comparable to the current day and yet the climate and distribution of ecosystems were quite different. One intriguing, but not fully understood, feature of the early to mid-Pliocene climate is the amplified Arctic temperature response and its impact on Arctic ecosystems. Only the most recent models appear to correctly estimate the degree of warming in the Pliocene Arctic and validation of the currently proposed feedbacks is limited by scarce terrestrial records of climate and environment. Here we reconstruct the summer temperature and fire regime from a subfossil fen-peat deposit on west–central Ellesmere Island, Canada, that has been chronologically constrained using cosmogenic nuclide burial dating to 3.9+1.5/-0.5 Ma. The estimate for average mean summer temperature is 15.4±0.8 ∘C using s","unwound_url":"https://cp.copernicus.org/articles/15/1063/2019/"},{"start":264,"end":287,"url":"https://t.co/1axaHajTnp","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/TethLL/status/1373939054891266052/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/1axaHajTnp","images":{}},{"start":264,"end":287,"url":"https://t.co/1axaHajTnp","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/TethLL/status/1373939054891266052/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/1axaHajTnp","images":{}},{"start":264,"end":287,"url":"https://t.co/1axaHajTnp","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/TethLL/status/1373939054891266052/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/1axaHajTnp","images":{}},{"start":264,"end":287,"url":"https://t.co/1axaHajTnp","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/TethLL/status/1373939054891266052/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/1axaHajTnp","images":{}}],"annotations":{}},"author_id":"1393338992","attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1373938871835140098","3_1373938871839248384","3_1373938871893815299","3_1373938956610400259"]},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter Web App","id":"1373938728218025990","lang":"en","created_at":"2021-03-22T10:04:54.000Z","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":1,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"in_reply_to_user_id":"303999750","text":"@AndynBrown16 @EnvAgencyNW @RibbleTrust @prestoncouncil @southribblebc @Lancswildlife Hi Andy, lovely to see the otters playing in the Ribble.
