H2S is produced endogenously and can be administered exogenously. Recent studies showed that H2S in cancers has both pro- and antitumor roles. Understanding the difference in the expression and localization of tissue-specific H2S-producing enzymes in healthy and cancer tissues allows us to develop tools for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Urological malignancies are some of the most common cancers in both men and women, and their early detection is vital since advanced cancers are recurrent, metastatic, and often resistant to treatment. This review summarizes the roles of H2S in cancer and looks at current studies investigating H2S activity and expression of H2S-producing enzymes in urinary cancers. We specifically focused on urothelial carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer, as they form the majority of newly diagnosed urinary cancers.
