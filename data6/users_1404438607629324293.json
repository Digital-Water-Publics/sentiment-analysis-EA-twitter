Figures compiled by the campaign group Cut Carbon Not Forests show that the UK has overtaken Germany to become the top spender on biomass, which involves burning wood pellets largely imported from overseas. Government subsidies for the industry reached ¬£1.9bn in 2019, ahead of Germany's ¬£1.7bn, and a 60 per cent rise since 2015. In the UK one fifth of renewable energy subsidies go to biomass, compared to less than 15 per cent in France, which has the second-highest proportion. The industry argues that carbon is removed from the atmosphere when trees grow, making it a more sustainable alternative to fossil fuels, though critics say this process takes too long at a time when emissions need to be urgently cut to meet climate goals.

Figures compiled by the campaign group Cut Carbon Not Forests show that the UK has overtaken Germany to become the top spender on biomass, which involves burning wood pellets largely imported from overseas. Government subsidies for the industry reached ¬£1.9bn in 2019, ahead of Germany's ¬£1.7bn, and a 60 per cent rise since 2015. In the UK one fifth of renewable energy subsidies go to biomass, compared to less than 15 per cent in France, which has the second-highest proportion. The industry argues that carbon is removed from the atmosphere when trees grow, making it a more sustainable alternative to fossil fuels, though critics say this process takes too long at a time when emissions need to be urgently cut to meet climate goals.
